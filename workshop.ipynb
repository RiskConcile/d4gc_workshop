    "# 1. APIs and Web Scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "As humans, we interact with websites by **clicking, scrolling, and typing**.\n",
    "Computers, however, can’t “see” buttons or menus — they need **structured ways to talk** to the web.\n",

    "There are two main approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **APIs**, which are the official, structured conversations.\n",
    "2. **Web Scraping**, where our program imitates a user and reads information directly from web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs are like **asking a waiter for a dish** — you make a polite request and get exactly what you ordered.\n",
    "Scraping is more like **sneaking into the kitchen** to see what’s cooking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both are useful, but APIs are preferred when available: they’re cleaner, faster, and far less likely to break when a website changes.\n",

    "APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are **the backbone of modern applications**.\n",

    "### How REST APIs Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Most web APIs today follow the **REST** design:\n",
    "\n",
    "* They use standard web methods — **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, **DELETE** — to read, create, update, or remove data.\n",
    "* Each resource (for example, “stations” or “departures”) has its own **URL**.\n",
    "* Requests and responses are structured in **JSON**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "GET https://api.irail.be/liveboard/?station=Leuven&format=json\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This returns real-time train departures from Leuven Station.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "As data scientists, APIs give us **direct, structured access to live data**, without relying on messy or unstable web scraping. They’re the “professional” way for machines to communicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 **Let’s Code**\n",
    "We’ll make our first API call using the iRail public API — Belgium’s open train data — and visualize how data travels from the web into our Python program.\n"

    "\n",
    "Main methods to look for an element in a webpage (BY):\n",
