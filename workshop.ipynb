    "## 1. Overview — APIs and Web Scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "As humans, we interact with websites by **clicking, scrolling, and typing**.\n",
    "Computers, however, can’t “see” buttons or menus — they need **structured ways to talk** to the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"left\">\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **APIs**, which are the official, structured conversations.\n",
    "2. **Web Scraping**, where our program imitates a user and reads information directly from web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs are like **asking a waiter for a dish** — you make a polite request and get exactly what you ordered.\n",
    "Scraping is more like **sneaking into the kitchen** to see what’s cooking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both are useful, but APIs are preferred when available: they’re cleaner, faster, and far less likely to break when a website changes.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 2. API Calls\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are **the backbone of modern applications**.\n",
    "Every time you open Spotify, check Google Maps, or order an Uber, your device is making dozens of API calls behind the scenes — quietly fetching playlists, traffic data, or driver locations.\n",
    "\n",

    "### How REST APIs Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Most web APIs today follow the **REST** design:\n",
    "\n",
    "* They use standard web methods — **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, **DELETE** — to read, create, update, or remove data.\n",
    "* Each resource (for example, “stations” or “departures”) has its own **URL**.\n",
    "* Requests and responses are structured in **JSON**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "GET https://api.irail.be/liveboard/?station=Leuven&format=json\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This returns real-time train departures from Leuven Station.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "As data scientists, APIs give us **direct, structured access to live data**, without relying on messy or unstable web scraping. They’re the “professional” way for machines to communicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 **Let’s Code**\n",
    "We’ll make our first API call using the iRail public API — Belgium’s open train data — and visualize how data travels from the web into our Python program.\n"

    "## 3. Web Scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "Not every website offers an API.\n",
    "Sometimes, the only way to access information is to **read what’s already visible** on the page — just like a human would.\n",
    "That’s where **web scraping** comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scraping isn’t hacking — it’s **automated browsing** within fair-use limits.\n",
    "Our code acts as a mini-browser: it opens pages, looks for patterns in the HTML, and extracts the data we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Static vs Dynamic Pages\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Static pages**: all text is already in the HTML. → Tools like `BeautifulSoup` work perfectly.\n",
    "* **Dynamic pages**: content loads via JavaScript after the page opens. → We need **Selenium** to simulate a real browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Meet Selenium\n",
    "\n",
    "Selenium lets Python **control a browser** — open pages, click buttons, fill forms, and extract text once the data has loaded.\n",
    "It’s also widely used in automated website testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"left\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"data/assets/selenium_workflow.png\" alt=\"selenium_workflow\" width=\"200\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Launch a browser (`webdriver.Chrome()`).\n",
    "2. Open a URL (`.get(url)`).\n",
    "3. Wait for elements to load (`WebDriverWait`).\n",
    "4. Extract text (`find_element`, `find_elements`).\n",
    "5. Close the browser (`.quit()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 **Let’s Code**\n",
    "We’ll use Selenium to open a web page, wait for the content to appear, and extract specific information — just like a robot performing your browser actions automatically."
